## Architecture Overview

| Component         | Description                                                                                                   |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Backend API       | Python/FastAPI service for REST endpoints, thread management, and LLM integration (via LiteLLM).              |
| Frontend          | Next.js/React application providing a responsive chat interface and dashboard.                                |
| Agent Docker      | Isolated execution environment for each agent, supporting browser automation, code execution, and security.   |
| Supabase Database | Manages data persistence, authentication, user management, conversation history, analytics, and subscriptions.|

## Example Use Cases

- Market and competitor analysis, including automated report generation.
- Scraping and compiling lists (e.g., VC funds, job candidates, event speakers).
- Planning trips with weather-aware itineraries.
